Today I implemented all features seen in video 14, 15 and 16 from Gabreil Dechichi's playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw7F758vrsxxkQexyaLfKiAU2wo7BQXN9

Tomorrow I'm implementing the features from the last video and planning a level desing for the game :)

Today I prepared a Player, Enemy and Camera prefab for the level design.
I also filled my level with assets imported from the free asset package i'm using.

Next day, I'll try my best to fix the attack system, for the player is only attacking in front of him (should create another collider for his back? Or should try to move the collider when the sprite faces back?)
